# Contributing

The Reviewer project and all of its different components are open for contributors to suggest improvements and changes. We want to make contributing easy and transparent, so you can seamlessly:

- Suggest code improvements
- Submit fixes to well known issues
- Propose features
- Report bugs
- Add documentation

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to maintain and version code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as review and accept pull requests.

## Proposing changes

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the project (we use [Github Flow][1]). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. Make sure to cover at least 80% of newly added code.
3. If your proposal involves changes to some APIs, don't forget to update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Propose your pull request.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues][3]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Reporting a bug is as easy as [opening a new issue][4].

## Third-party code

If you use third party code with your code contribution such as, components, libraries, or snippets, ALL the following conditions must be satisfied:
- The third-party code must be licensed under a permissive open source license (e.g., BSD, MIT, Apache Software License, etc.) or a weak copyleft license (e.g., EPL, MPL, CPL, CDDL, etc.).
- The third-party code may not be modified.
- Details of the third-party code must be disclosed to the project (such as, component name, license, source URL, etc.).
- The third-party code must comply with any requirements/policies set out by the project.
